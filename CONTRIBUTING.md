# Contributing to Namespace

We welcome contributions to Namespace! Please read the following guidelines before submitting a pull request.

## Getting Started
Our JavaScript projects use the following tools to ensure code quality:
- [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for commit messages
- [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) for versioning

To get started, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
Commitizen will be automatically ran via Husky when you commit changes.
For commiting changes, run `npm run commit` or `git commit` and follow the prompts.
